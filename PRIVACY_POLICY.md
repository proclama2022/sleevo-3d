## Introduction

Welcome to Sleevo - Vinyl Shop Manager ("we," "our," or "the App"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile game collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

### Third-Party Services

#### Icon Resources
The App loads icons from Lucide Icons CDN (https://lucide.dev) for visual elements. This may result in your device's IP address being visible to their servers when loading these resources. We recommend reviewing Lucide's privacy practices at https://lucide.dev.

#### AI Services (Development Only)
The App's codebase includes a placeholder for Google's Gemini API, which is intended for development purposes only. **No AI services are currently active in the production version of the App**, and no data is sent to AI services during normal gameplay.
