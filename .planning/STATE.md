# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-10)

**Core value:** Every 30-60 seconds, the player must feel successful and want to play "just one more level"
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Campaign Structure & Star System Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Campaign Structure & Star System Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-10 — Roadmap created with 6 phases covering all 34 v1 requirements

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- **60 hand-crafted levels**: Hand-crafted allows controlled difficulty curve and teaching moments; research shows players need structure for engagement
- **3-star system with visible criteria**: Clear goals means players know if they're succeeding; industry standard (Candy Crush, Angry Birds)
- **Remove negative random events**: Research shows frustration kills retention; bonus-only events feel rewarding
- **Enhance visual feedback significantly**: "Juice" is critical for hypercasual retention; every action must feel powerful

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (Level Design):**
- Boss level mechanic patterns may need additional research during planning (unique puzzle mechanics for climax moments)
- Difficulty balancing methodology needs development (scoring algorithm across multiple dimensions)

**Phase 3 (Visual Effects):**
- Device-tier detection for performance scaling needs validation on target devices
- Particle count limits need actual mobile testing to determine optimal values

None blocking immediate work on Phase 1.
