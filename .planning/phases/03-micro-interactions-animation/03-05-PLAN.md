# Plan 03-05: Human Verification Checkpoint

**Goal:** Visual and feel verification of all Phase 3 micro-interactions and animations.

**Type:** Human verification (requires visual testing and subjective assessment)

**Requirements Verified:** MOTION-01 through MOTION-05

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Verify MOTION-01 Card Pickup Animation</name>
  <what-built>Complete MOTION-01: Card pickup animation with 200-250ms duration, spring easing, 1.08 scale</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Launch game on mobile device (iOS Safari or Android Chrome)
2. Touch and drag a vinyl card from counter
3. Observe pickup animation
4. Verify: Card scales to ~1.08, pickup feels "snappy", shadow deepens, animation completes in ~200-250ms
  </how-to-verify>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Verify MOTION-02 Card Drop Animation</name>
  <what-built>Complete MOTION-02: Card drop animation with 150-200ms duration, Material easing, smooth settle</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Drag vinyl card to valid slot
2. Drop card (release touch)
3. Observe settle animation
4. Verify: Card scales back to 1.0 smoothly, settle feels satisfying, animation completes in ~150-200ms, card lands cleanly
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Verify MOTION-03 Shelf Hover State</name>
  <what-built>Complete MOTION-03: Shelf hover state with 150ms in, 200-300ms out, glow pulse</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Drag vinyl card over shelf slot
2. Hover without dropping
3. Move card away from slot
4. Verify: Slot highlights within 150ms, glow ring appears, glow pulses subtly, highlight fades over 200-300ms
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues</resume-signal>

  <name>Verify MOTION-04 Score Celebration</name>
  <what-built>Complete MOTION-04: Score increment with 300-400ms celebration (particle burst)</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Place vinyl correctly
2. Observe particle burst animation
3. Verify: 8-12 particles burst from slot, radiate outward, fade over ~600ms, coordinate with sparkle
  </how-to-verify>

  <what-built>Complete MOTION-05: Combo popup with 600-800ms duration, rewards streaks at 4+ threshold</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Place 4+ correct vinyls consecutively
2. Trigger combo popup
3. Verify: Popup appears at 4+ streak, shows point bonus (e.g., "+150"), positioned near slot, doesn't block gameplay

  <how-to-verify>
1. Shake: Place vinyl in wrong slot → verify shake is ~150ms with 2-3 oscillations, feels snappy
2. Combo reset: Build 5x streak, make wrong placement → verify streak becomes 4x (not 0)
3. Pickup: Drag card → verify scale 1.08 feels energetic, not sluggish

1. Enable reduced motion in browser settings
2. Reload game
3. Test all animations: pickup (instant/no anim), drop (instant/no anim), hover (instant color), shake (disabled), particles (static)
4. Verify: All interactions still work, functionality preserved

1. Test on iOS Safari (iPhone), Android Chrome (Pixel), Desktop Safari/Chrome
2. Verify: All animations play smoothly, no visual glitches, consistent timing
3. Performance: Run Chrome DevTools Performance tab, verify 60fps during animations, no memory leaks

## Success Criteria

### All MOTION Requirements:
- [ ] MOTION-01: Card pickup feels springy and responsive
- [ ] MOTION-02: Card drop settles satisfyingly into slot
- [ ] MOTION-03: Hover states provide instant feedback
- [ ] MOTION-04: Score increment celebrates points earned
- [ ] MOTION-05: Combo popup rewards consecutive correct placements

### All User Decisions:
- [ ] Combo threshold: 4+ correct placements
- [ ] Combo display: Points bonus only ("+150")
- [ ] Combo position: Near placed slot
- [ ] Combo reset: Reduce by 1 (forgiving)
- [ ] Shake duration: 150ms, 2-3 oscillations
- [ ] Pickup scale: 1.08 (energetic feel)
- [ ] Particle burst: 8-12 particles radiating outward

### Accessibility:
- [ ] Reduced motion respected across all animations

### Performance:
- [ ] 60fps maintained during all animations
- [ ] No memory leaks or performance issues

## Verification Method

**Tools:**
- Real device testing (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Browser DevTools (Performance profiler)
- Accessibility inspector (reduced motion testing)

**Testers:**
- Primary: Developer implementing plans
- Secondary: Designer or product owner (subjective feel assessment)

**Pass/Fail Criteria:**
- **Pass:** All acceptance criteria met, no blocking issues
- **Fail:** Blocking issue found (create gap closure plan)
- **Conditional:** Minor issues (document, defer to future phase)

---

## Files Modified

None (verification only)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** All previous plans (03-01 through 03-04)

**Blocks:** Phase completion (all requirements must pass verification)

## Phase

**Phase:** 03-micro-interactions-animation
**Plan:** 05
**Type:** verify

---

## Notes

- This is a **human verification checkpoint** — not automated
- Subjective feel is important (game feel requires playtesting)
- Document any issues in gap closure plans if needed
- Take notes on what feels good/bad for future iterations
