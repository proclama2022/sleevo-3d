# Plan 03-04: Card Pickup Animation Polish

**Goal:** Increase pickup scale to 1.08-1.1x for more energetic "snappy" feel during drag.

**User Decision from 03-CONTEXT.md:**
> "Pickup scale: Scale up 1.05-1.1x during lift — adds energy to the gesture"

**Requirements Satisfied:** MOTION-01 (Card pickup animation with spring easing)

**Current State:**
- Pickup scale: 1.05x (fixed in VinylCard.tsx)
- Spring easing: `cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)` (correct)
- Shadow depth: Dynamic (grows during drag, correct)

**Target State:**
- Pickup scale: 1.08x (within 1.05-1.1x range)
- Same spring easing (no change)
- Same shadow behavior (no change)

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update Pickup Scale in VinylCard</name>
  <files>src/components/VinylCard/VinylCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Find the transform CSS that applies scale during dragging state. Update from scale(1.05) to scale(1.08):
```typescript
transform: ${(props) => {
  if (props.$state === 'dragging') {
    return 'scale(1.08) rotate(2deg)';
  }
  return 'scale(1)';
}};
```
Per user decision from 03-CONTEXT.md: "Pickup scale: Scale up 1.05-1.1x during lift — adds energy to the gesture"
</action>
  <verify>Dragging state now scales to 1.08 (was 1.05). Rotation remains 2deg. Idle state remains scale(1).</verify>
  <done>Pickup scale increased to 1.08 for more energetic feel</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify Spring Easing in Keyframes</name>
  <files>src/animations/keyframes.ts</files>
  <action>
Verify cardPickup keyframes have correct spring overshoot animation. Expected:
```typescript
export const cardPickup = keyframes`
  0% { transform: scale(1); box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); }
  50% { transform: scale(1.08); box-shadow: 0 12px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25); }
  100% { transform: scale(1.05); box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2); }
`;
```
The 50% keyframe should have scale(1.08) for spring overshoot. The 100% keyframe should settle at scale(1.05) final dragging state. No changes needed if already correct.
</action>
  <verify>Keyframes have scale(1.08) at 50% for spring overshoot. 100% keyframe settles at scale(1.05). Matches VinylCard.tsx transform.</verify>
  <done>Spring easing verified in keyframes (no changes if already correct)</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify Drag Shadow Depth</name>
  <files>src/components/VinylCard/VinylCard.tsx</files>
  <action>
Verify shadow deepens during drag. Expected:
```typescript
${(props) => props.$state === 'dragging' && css`
  box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
  cursor: grabbing;
`}
${(props) => props.$state !== 'dragging' && css`
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
`}
```
Idle shadow should be 0 2px 8px (subtle). Dragging shadow should be 0 8px 24px (deep, elevated feel). No changes needed if already correct.
Per user decision from 03-CONTEXT.md: "Drag shadow: Dynamic shadow — shadow grows deeper as card lifts, adds depth and separation"
</action>
  <verify>Idle shadow is 0 2px 8px. Dragging shadow is 0 8px 24px. Shadow grows as card lifts.</verify>
  <done>Drag shadow depth verified (no changes if already correct)</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Pickup scale increased to 1.08 for more energetic feel with spring overshoot animation</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Touch and drag vinyl card → verify pickup feels "snappy" and energetic
2. Compare to old 1.05 → should feel more responsive
3. Test on mobile → verify touch latency feels instant (<100ms)
4. Drag to screen edge → verify 1.08 scale doesn't cause overflow
5. If 1.08 feels wrong, test 1.06 (subtle) or 1.10 (maximum)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Pickup scale is 1.08x (increased from 1.05x)
- [ ] Pickup feels "snappy" and energetic
- [ ] Spring animation provides overshoot during pickup
- [ ] Shadow deepens during drag (no change needed)
- [ ] No visual issues at screen edges

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Drag vinyl card → verify scale increases to 1.08
- [ ] Compare to previous 1.05 scale → should feel more responsive
- [ ] Test on mobile → verify touch latency feels instant
- [ ] Drag to screen edge → verify no overflow issues
- [ ] Drop card → verify smooth settle back to scale(1)
- [ ] Enable reduced motion → verify pickup animation is disabled

---

## Files Modified

- `src/components/VinylCard/VinylCard.tsx` - Update pickup scale (1.05 → 1.08)

---

## Dependencies

**Depends on:** None (independent polish)

**Blocks:** None (pure visual refinement)

## Phase

**Phase:** 03-micro-interactions-animation
**Plan:** 04
**Type:** execute

## Notes

- 1.08 was chosen as middle-ground between 1.05 (conservative) and 1.10 (energetic)
- Spring easing already provides overshoot animation (0% → 50% → 100%)
- Shadow behavior already correct (dynamic depth during drag)
- This is subjective — human verification recommended to confirm feel
