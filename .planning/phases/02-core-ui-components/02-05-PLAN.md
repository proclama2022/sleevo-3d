<objective>
Human verification checkpoint to confirm all Phase 2 components are visually correct and functional after updates.

Purpose: All four components have been updated. User needs to verify they match their design vision before proceeding.
Output: User approval to proceed to Phase 3.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 1: Human verification of all Phase 2 components</name>
  <files>N/A - Visual verification</files>
  <action>
Human verification checkpoint. Inspect all four updated components in the running application to confirm they match locked design decisions.
  </action>
  <what-built>
All four core UI components have been updated to match locked decisions:

1. **VinylCard** - Now shows vinyl+sleeve shape with offset, text overlaid on art, 100px size
2. **ShelfSlot** - Now has recessed filled state and sparkle effect on correct placement
3. **HUD** - Now has transparent bar, centered gauge, no level name, Score/Timer/Moves only
4. **ProgressBar** - Circular SVG gauge with vintage tick marks

All components meet 44x44px touch targets, use shape+color for feedback, and respect reduced motion.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the app in browser (typically http://localhost:5173)

3. **Verify VinylCard:**
   - Card shows vinyl disc offset from sleeve (not just square)
   - Genre/year/title text is overlaid on art (not below)
   - Card is approximately 100px wide
   - Dragging the card shows scale change, border highlight, deeper shadow
   - Placed state shows green checkmark (valid) or red X (invalid)

4. **Verify ShelfSlot:**
   - Empty slots show wood grain texture
   - When dragging starts, all slots show pulsing glow (green for valid, red for invalid)
   - When vinyl is placed, slot shows recessed/inset appearance
   - Correct placement triggers brief sparkle/glimmer effect

5. **Verify HUD:**
   - HUD bar at top is semi-transparent (game shows through)
   - Circular progress gauge is centered
   - Left side shows Score
   - Right side shows Timer and Moves
   - NO level name is displayed

6. **Verify Touch Targets:**
   - On mobile or with dev tools mobile simulation, verify all interactive elements are easy to tap
   - Cards and slots should feel comfortable to touch

7. **Verify Reduced Motion:**
   - In System Preferences > Accessibility > Display, enable "Reduce motion"
   - Refresh the page
   - Animations should be instant/minimal
  </how-to-verify>
  <verify>User confirms all components are visually correct and functional</verify>
  <done>User types "approved" and all verification items are confirmed</done>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to proceed to Phase 3, or describe any issues that need to be fixed</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>
